# JumperTools
A small collection of Lmaobox LUA scripts designed to help you with rocket jumping.
Originally started off as one script to learn how to negate fall damage via syncing rockets.

### ![[JumpMetrics]](https://github.com/swingstuhisback/jumpertools/blob/main/JumpMetrics.lua)
Script that displays various information including: 
- **Height from ground** *_(in Hammer Units)_*
- **Velocity** *_(in Hammer Units)_*
- **Frames per second**

Mostly customizable to your liking *(if you know how to)*.

I will **not** be providing any help on how to install these. It is up to you.
